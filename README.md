## What is JSleep?
JSleep is my attempt to learn Android developement by learning the to make an app that simulates a hotel booking experience.
It's a part of my Object Oriented Programming study at Computer Engineering, University of Indonesia.
## How to use?
To use it, you need to have the backend running on your computer. You can find the backend [here](github.com/irbirojodoh/JSleep).
After you have the backend running, you can change the IP address in the `UtilsApi.java` file to your computer's IP address. Ff you're using an emulator leave it as it is.
Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio. Then, you can run it on your phone or emulator.
